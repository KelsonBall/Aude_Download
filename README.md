# Aude

Aude (pronounced 'Ode') is a music synthesis program for the Windows platform developed by Kelson Ball.

It is currently being evaluated for market viability. 

# Disclaimer

Aude is pre-release software. Expect it to delete itself after a few days. 
Expect file formats to change (and therefore destroying all previous work). 
Expect the application to crash unexpectedly. Expect buttons to do nothing and tabs to be blank. 
If you can figure out a reliable set of steps that cause the application to crash or exhibit other unexpected behavior, please go the the `Issues` tab on this github
repository and either add a new issue or comment on an existing similar one.
